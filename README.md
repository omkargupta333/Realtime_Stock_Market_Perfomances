Stock Market Titans: Examining the Reign of Apple, Microsoft, Google, Netflix Analysis usingÂ Python.

In the project titled "Stock Market Titans: Examining the Reign of Apple, Microsoft, Google, Netflix, Amazon Analysis using Python," the aim was to analyze the stock performance of five major companies: Apple, Microsoft, Google, Netflix, and Amazon. The project utilized several Python libraries, including pandas, yfinance, datetime, and plotly.

The analysis focused on the stock performance of these companies over the past six months. By using the yfinance library, the project fetched the stock data for each company and stored it in a pandas DataFrame. This DataFrame allowed for easy manipulation and analysis of the data.

The primary objective was to examine the correlation between the stock prices of Apple and Microsoft. The correlation coefficient, calculated using the pandas library, indicated the strength of the relationship between the two stocks. In this case, a strong linear relationship was observed, suggesting that when Apple's stock price increases, Microsoft's stock price tends to increase as well. This positive correlation implies a similarity or connection between the two companies, which could be influenced by industry trends, market conditions, or shared business partners or customers.

For investors, this strong correlation between Apple and Microsoft stocks presents an opportunity for diversification. By investing in both companies, investors can potentially reduce risk and balance their portfolio. Since the stocks tend to move in the same direction, when one performs well, the other is likely to follow suit. This means that both stocks may offer similar potential returns and risks.

To visualize the stock performance, the project employed the plotly library. Interactive plots were created to showcase how the stock prices of Apple, Microsoft, Google, Netflix, and Amazon changed over the past six months. These visualizations help identify any trends or patterns in the stock data, aiding investors in making informed decisions.

In summary, this project utilized Python and various libraries to analyze the stock performance of major companies and explore the correlation between Apple and Microsoft stocks. The findings suggest a strong positive correlation, providing an opportunity for investors to diversify their portfolios and potentially benefit from the similar performance and risks of these two stocks.
